										<h2>Laser hair reduction and unwanted hair</h2>
										<p>There are many methods for hair removal, <a
												href={{ "/services/hair-removal/" | relative_url }}>laser hair removal</a> being the most
											effective and efficient.</p>
										<p>Women and men seek hair treatments generally for cosmetic reasons, that
											sometimes are related to medical conditions (such as
											<strong>hirsutism</strong> or <strong>hypertrichosis</strong>).</p>
										<p><strong>Hirsutism</strong> is excessive hair growth on the face, arms, and
											legs, especially in women.</p>
										<p><strong>Hypertrichosis</strong>, or excessive growth of hair where hair does
											not normally grow.</p>
										<p>Hair growth is dependent on hormones (which are derived from the thyroid,
											pituitary adrenal and ovarian glands) and genetic predisposition. Hormonal
											shifts any time during one&#8217;s life can produce some new and most likely
											unwanted hair growth. Oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and menopause are
											prime examples.</p>
										<p>Overactive thyroid, or taking thyroid medication can also drive new hair
											growth.</p>
										<p>Hair is made of a type of protein called keratin. A single hair consists of a
											hair shaft (the part that shows), a root (below the skin), and a follicle,
											from which the hair root grows. At the lower end of the follicle is the hair
											bulb, where the hair&#8217;s pigment, or melanin is produced.</p>
										<p><strong>Hair growth occurs in three phases:</strong></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Anagen (the hair is actively making pigment in the root of the hair
												follicle)</li>
											<li>Catagen ( the follicle has shed the hair)</li>
											<li>Telogen (the hair is in the follicle, but is not making pigment in the
												root of the follicle).</li>
										</ol>
										<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2672"
												src={{ "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hair-stage.jpg" | relative_url }} alt="" width="307"
												height="164"
												sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" />The only phase of hair growth
											that is affected by the laser is the <strong>Anagen</strong> phase (hair
											follicles have more pigment).</p>
										<p>The normal hair growth cycle is 4-8 weeks.</p>
										<p>Treatment areas starting at the collar-bone and above are scheduled 4 weeks
											apart; collar-bone and below are 6-8 weeks apart.</p>
										<p><em>Scheduling treatments too early or too late in the growth cycle may make
												additional treatments necessary.</em></p>
										<p>The laser works by sending a beam of light through the skin to the hair
											follicle and heating the hair bulb. There will be some pinkness and swelling
											around the hair follicle. This is transient and usually lasts 15 minutes to
											a few hours.</p>
										<p>Aloe vera gel or cool compresses may be applied at home for discomfort.</p>
										<p>The laser targets melanin (which gives hair it&#8217;s pigment), therefore
											blonde, gray, red, or fine peach fuzz hair will not respond to the laser.
										</p>
										<p>The treatment is mildly uncomfortable. Most clients say it feels like a
											rubber band snap. However, most of the pain is alleviated with our advanced
											cooling system.</p>
										<p>Most clients require 6-8 treatments to get the maximum benefit of the laser
											treatment. People with darker skin types may need more treatments.</p>
										<p>People with underlying hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovaries, adrenal
											hyperplasia, use of oral steroids, or a strong genetic tendency for hair
											growth may also need additional treatments.</p>
										<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> avoid the sun, tanning booths, and artificial
											tanning creams and spray (on treated area) 2-4 weeks before, during and 2-4
											weeks after laser treatment. It is mandatory to use a sunscreen with a
											<strong>TOTAL SUN BLOCK</strong> and a <strong>SPF 30</strong> or greater.
										</p>
										<p>You should not wax, tweeze, or pluck the hair for 4-6 weeks prior to
											treatment and after the laser treatment.</p>
										<p><strong>Call us with any questions or concerns.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Skin type, hair color</strong> and <strong>texture, client&#8217;s
												age, financial status,</strong> and <strong>personal
												expectation</strong> should be considered prior to any intervention.</p>
										<p>There are numerous types of lasers available for laser hair removal so the
											results of the treatment and safety may vary significantly.</p>
										<p>At Svetlana&#8217;s Skin Secrets we offer state-of-the-art <strong>Harmony
												XL</strong> laser for comfortable, safe and effective treatment of
											unwanted hair and hair reduction.</p>
